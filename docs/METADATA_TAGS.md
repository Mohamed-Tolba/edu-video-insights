### Dataset Tag Convention

We use a structured tag to group videos by course, semester, and institution:

Format: `[institution-code]_[unit-code]_[semester-code]`

Examples:
- `monash_trc2201_s2-2024`
- `unsw_mech1001_t1-2023`
- `uq_engg1300_s1-2025`

This allows filtering, analysis, and comparison across cohorts and institutions. Add this value to `dataset_tag` in your submission or leave it blank to be autogenerated.
